# Data Science Project: Disaster_Response_Pipeline

## Introduction

Welcome to our Data Science project on Disaster Response Pipeline, where we build a pipeline using NLP and machine learning to help improve response during disaster.

## Installation

To get started, you can clone the repo by running the following command:
git clone https://github.com/jek1705/Disaster_Response_Pipeline.git

## Project Motivation

This project is a part of my Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program, where we aim to provide help during disaster to select only the most relevant messages among the too many received at a time where it capacity to answer is the most limited.

## File Descriptions

The database with disaster_messages.csv and disaster_categories.csv is included in the GitHub repository, along with the main Python files (process_data.py and train_classifier.py) to run the model and the web app.
